  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <P>
    This is me ---->>> üôÇ.
  <P>
    A sweet simple cool girl always having a smile on face .
    No hate for anybody. I just spread LOVE everywhere.</p>
  <p>
    I am very emotional person and sometimes I cry alone but i am not weak.
    I am Single and I never had a boyfriend before but that doesn't mean that I never loved a person.
    Once I loved a guy truely but he never appreciated my efforts and left me becauses he was just a casanova and wanted to just use me for his satisfaction.
    I never appreciate temporary relationships because when I get attached to a person it becomes very difficult for me to leave them because of the
    memories which hurt even after a person has gone from our life.
    Some people move on very easily and that's why after heartbreaks they come in new relationships very easily.
    But I am not like those. I respect loyality.
  </p>
  <P>
    Hey, bored beacuse of such "rotdu" and weak points of mine???
    Okay let me show you how strong and intresting person I am in real life. So because of those heartbreaks it doesn't mean that I am completely shattered.
    I am special and important for my own and I love myself.
    Let me tell you a funny part that I am a Sapiosexual type girl, so even if a guy is not that handsome but if he has a great mind and intelligence then nobody can save that guy from my lust!!!
    (thats why most of the genius people like Einstein and Newton had left this planet before 6 Oct, 2002.)
  </p>

  <P>
    I love food and i know how to eat "pet bhar k" but what I don't know is how to cook.
    Let we assume that I am all alone and you arrived as a guest for supper then you will be served two things by me first one would be boiled water(aye!!! my boiled water is very tasty)
    and another one would be maggie.
  </P>
  <p>
    I love talking. I had a lot of friends during my school time. But becauase of NEET I am not getting enough time for them.
    So I am in contact with my few friends only but i don't talk to them regularly as i don't have enough time.
